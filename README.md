# HabitRabbit
Habit app created by Ian and Leon 

This is an app centered around keeping all the things you would want to track or write down in life all in one place, kinda of like an all in one life tracker. Anywhere from shopping lists to daily habit tracking this app is planned to have all that in one place. 
Please feel free to add any notes onto this page that you see fit
